### This project was created during MangoHacks 2018 at Florida International University in Miami, FL. 

We made it with toddlers and elderly adults in mind, in an attempt to prevent under or overdosage. The whole team has experience with young children getting into medicine cabinets or older fammily members forgetting to take their medicine, or even double dosing because they forgot they took the meds earlier in the day. This device was designed to **avoid that completely**. 

The project works through utilization of RFID/NFC cards for the first step in authentication, and facial recognition as the second step. The device then dispenses the correct amount of medicine based on the individual's prescription, and can work with a seemingly infinite list of users.
### Hardware
The hardware used include a Raspberry Pi, two Arduinos, a relay, an electronic lock solenoid, and various 3D printed parts. This was all mounted on a board for hackathon display purposes.
